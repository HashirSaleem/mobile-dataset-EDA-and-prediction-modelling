## Introduction

In this project, we use a dataset of mobile features to predict their prices. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify the price range of mobiles based 
on their features. We perform data cleaning, EDA, and apply multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features of mobile phones and their corresponding price ranges. The key features include battery power, clock speed, 
RAM, etc.
